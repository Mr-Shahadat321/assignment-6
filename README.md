#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

Ans :- From my point of view, map(), forEach(), and filter() each work as like as loop,
bellow i explain basic of this three es6 features very shortly. 

map() :- map() return a new array. 

forEach() :- forEach() not return just do action.

filter() :- return new array as like map() but using filter() method we can condition also. 



#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

Ans :- For me i think arrow functions are a shorter, cleaner way to write functions in ES6.

regular function :

 function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

Arrow function :-

const add = (a, b) => a + b;    [Easy and most flexible to read and auto return]



#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Ans :- I think destructuring assignment in ES6 allows me to quickly extract values from arrays and objects into variables.



#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Ans :- I think one of the most powerfull feature is template literals in ES6. For me Template literals in ES6 make string writing easier by using backticks and ${} to add variables or expressions, unlike old concatenatw  with +.
